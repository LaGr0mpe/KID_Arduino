# KID_Arduino
Small Arduino KID with the most popular sensors

I’ve put together a small pet project based on Arduino. I used an Arduino Nano, a 1000 mAh battery, a TP4056 charging module with protection (“2-in-1” type), an MT3608 boost converter,
a joystick module for Arduino (KY-023), a 1.8" ST7735 display, an ultrasonic distance sensor, a potentiometer, and several LEDs and resistors. The case was 3D-printed.

**Notes for improvement:**
The case should be extended by about 1 cm, and the cutout for the display should be shifted to the left to provide enough space next to the joystick.
The charging port cutout should also be moved closer to the bottom. Other than that, the case is comfortable to use.
